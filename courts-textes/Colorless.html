        <pre>
            I'm broken glass
            I may be beautiful
            But the rays of light
            Aren't making me feel full

            Being happy doesn't mean anything
            If nobody around you see a thing
            Yet they blame you for all you are
            They just can't see how much you made it far

            One single crack is all it takes
            To make them see a slacker
            Only can survive if you're a withstander
            Keeping the calmness of the lakes

            Can I keep my colors without being made ashamed of it?
