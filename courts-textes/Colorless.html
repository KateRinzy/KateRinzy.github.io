        <pre>
I'm broken glass
I may be beautiful
But the rays of light
Aren't making me feel full

Being happy doesn't mean anything
If nobody around you see a thing
Yet they blame you for all you are
They just can't see how much you made it far

One single crack is all it takes
To make them see a slacker
Can only survive if you're a withstander
Keeping the calmness of the lakes

They speak as if they figured it out
But I'm just burnt-out
I do not seek glory
I only seek to be happy

Can I keep my colors
without being made ashamed of it?
